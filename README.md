Predicting Health Scores Without Nutritional Information
The folders in this repo are used for predicting the healthiness of recipes without using nutritional information.

Two Datasets are used, one for yummly and one for all_recipes.  The code is inherently the same though I kept the datasets separate for execution purposes.

The datasets (not my own as I used a dataset from a different research paper) can be found online here: https://github.com/mchenSDU/NutRec/blob/master/dataDescription.txt
